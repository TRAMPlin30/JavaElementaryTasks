but i must explain to you how all REPLACEMENT STRING this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and i will give
you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the
master-builder of human REPLACEMENT STRING happiness. no one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure,
but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful.
nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues REPLACEMENT STRING or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because
occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. to take a trivial example,
which of us ever undertakes REPLACEMENT STRING laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? but who has any
right to find fault with a man who chooses REPLACEMENT STRING to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids
a pain that produces no resultant pleasure
